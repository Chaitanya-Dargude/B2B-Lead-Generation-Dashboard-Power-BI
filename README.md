## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard analyzes B2B lead conversion performance using a simulated dataset.
It tracks key lead generation metrics, channel performance, and user behavior to help businesses optimize their sales funnel.

## Objectives
1. Analyze total leads, conversions, and conversion rates
2. Identify high-performing lead sources like LinkedIn, Email, etc.
3. Compare visitor engagement (page views, time on site)
4. Explore effectiveness by specialization and occupation
5. Provide interactive navigation and filtering for business insights

## Tools Used
1. Power BI Desktop – for dashboard design and data visualization
2. Power Query – for data cleaning and transformation
3. DAX – to calculate KPIs like Conversion Rate, Avg Page Views
4. GitHub – to host and showcase the project

## Dashboard Features
1. KPI Cards – Total Leads, Converted Leads, Conversion Rate %, Avg Time on Site, Avg Page Views
2. Charts – Pie, Bar, Column, and Stacked visuals
3. Slicers – Filter by Channel, Specialization, Occupation
4. Interactive Page Navigation – Simulates an app-like experience

## Key Insights from Dashboard Analysis:
1. Overall Conversion Rate is 36%
Explanation:
Out of 50 total leads, 18 successfully converted. This shows a moderate conversion performance.
You can use this benchmark to compare how different sources, occupations, and specializations perform.
  1. Action: Improve engagement strategies for the remaining 64% by analyzing their dropout points.

2. LinkedIn and Email Campaigns are Top-Performing Lead Sources
Explanation:
Among all lead sources, LinkedIn and Email Campaigns have higher conversion ratios compared to others like Facebook or Referral. This means your digital outbound strategy is more effective than referrals or social media ads.
  2. Action: Invest more in LinkedIn outreach and email marketing automation.

3. Marketing and IT Specializations Convert Better
Explanation:
Leads with a Marketing or IT specialization show higher conversion rates — possibly because your service/product resonates more with their domain needs.
  3. Action: Customize follow-up messaging and offers for these domains to further boost conversions.

4. Students Convert More Than Working Professionals
Explanation:
When grouped by occupation, Students showed higher engagement (longer time on site, more page views) and higher conversion. This suggests your content or offering appeals more to this group.
  4. Action: Create targeted student campaigns or internship programs to leverage this behavior.

5. Engaged Visitors are More Likely to Convert
Explanation:
Leads who spent more than 250 seconds on your website and visited more than 3 pages per session had significantly better conversion.
This proves that time on site and page views are strong indicators of intent.
  5. Action: Add more engaging CTAs and lead capture forms on high-traffic pages to improve conversion.

6. 'Form Submitted' Activity Leads to Higher Conversions
Explanation:
The last activity before conversion is often Form Submitted, indicating it's a strong lead qualifier.
In contrast, leads with "Page Visited" or "SMS Sent" as last activity tend to not convert.
  6. Action: Streamline your funnel to encourage form submission earlier in the journey.

7. Do Not Email = Low Engagement & Low Conversion
Explanation:
Leads that opted out of emails had lower visit time and fewer conversions, showing the importance of email follow-ups in nurturing.
  7. Action: Improve opt-in rates by highlighting benefits of email content during signup.

## Conclusion
- This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive and interactive analysis of B2B lead generation and conversion performance. By leveraging DAX, Power Query, and custom visuals, the project highlights critical insights such as top-performing lead sources, effective specializations, and the behavioral patterns of high-converting users.

- The analysis revealed that platforms like LinkedIn and Email Campaigns drive the highest conversion rates, while Marketing and IT specializations show stronger intent.
